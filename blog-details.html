              <h3>● Female Entrepreneurs (Mean = 3.04): </h3>
              <p>More responsive to social cues and peer validation, women often consider group 
feedback or the success stories of others before making investment decisions. This 
pattern highlights a collaborative approach to finance, emphasizing trust, mutual 
reassurance, and continuous learning through interaction and shared experiences. </p>

  <h3>● Male Entrepreneurs (Mean = 2.86):  </h3>

              <p>Men generally approach investment decisions with greater independence, basing their 
choices on personal judgment, experience, and analytical reasoning. Although they 
acknowledge the insights gained from peers, such opinions are often viewed as 
supplementary information rather than decisive factors. This pattern highlights a 
self-reliant financial mindset rooted in confidence and strategic thinking. </p>
<br>

<p>This gender gap demonstrates that women build investment confidence through collaboration 
and social interaction, while men derive confidence from independence, personal analysis, 
and rational evaluation of financial choices. </p>

              <p class="ud-blog-details-para">Entrepreneurs in higher socio-economic groups are more likely to consult professional 
financial experts and mentors before making investment decisions. With greater access to 
formal training, advisory services, and business networks, they use expert opinions to 
refine strategies, manage risk, and pursue long-term financial stability. This group’s 
reliance on expert advice reflects both confidence and access—two advantages closely 
tied to financial privilege. 
</p>

<h3 class="ud-blog-details-subtitle">● Middle Class (Mean = 3.26):</h3>

<p class="ud-blog-details-para">The majority of respondents belong to the middle socio-economic class. These 
entrepreneurs typically balance expert recommendations with independent research and 
peer input. They tend to rely on a mix of online financial resources, informal mentoring, 
and self-study to make informed choices. This blended approach highlights adaptability 
and determination to bridge the gap between limited access and informed investing.</p>

<h3 class="ud-blog-details-subtitle">● Lower Class (Mean = 3.14): </h3>

<p class="ud-blog-details-para">Entrepreneurs in lower socio-economic groups often depend on personal experience, 
family insights, or peer networks when making investment decisions. Limited access to 
expert consultation and financial education can make professional advice less attainable. 
However, this group demonstrates initiative by seeking knowledge from community 
connections and free digital platforms, proving that financial awareness can grow even in
